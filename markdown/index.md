# About me
I'm 25 years old; completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. 

I'm a whole hearted food lover: fan of burgers, pizza, salad, steak, and tacos. 

Opinions are my own.

"Think twice, code once!" whenever possible.

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who lives and breathes Open Source Software (OSS), and believes it's up to us to help Make the Web great, again.
