# About me
I'm 23 years old; completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering. 

I'm a whole hearted food lover: fan of burgers, pizza, salad, steak, and tacos. 

I'm considered by many a tech enthusiast, I find myself Beta testing all the things: Google Chrome Canary, Android 7.1 Nougat, WebKit. 

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer who lives and breathes Open Source Software (OSS), and believes it's up to us to help Make the Web great, again.
